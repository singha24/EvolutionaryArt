Welcome to Group 14's Biomorph Generator.

To use this software you can choose to either use Voice Recognition to start the evolutionary process by using the following command: 
	EVOLVE followed by a number between 1 and 8: which represents which child you would like to use.
The alternative is to use the evolve button to step one generation at a time to evolve the Biomorphs to your choosing. 

Our software makes it easier for you to navigate around the UI by using shortcuts.

CTRL + P = Print
CTRL + S = Save as image
ALT + P = Voice Recognition.
